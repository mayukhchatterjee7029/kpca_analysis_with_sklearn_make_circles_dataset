# Kernel-PCA in Machine Learning (IITM Assignment)

This Jupyter Notebook, part of an IIT Madras assignment, explores Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). It covers the implementation of polynomial and Gaussian (RBF) kernel matrices, along with projections, centering, and Frobenius norm calculations, using the `make_circles` dataset from scikit-learn.

## Features

* Implementation of polynomial and Gaussian (RBF) kernel matrices
* Projections and centering techniques
* Frobenius norm calculations
* Analysis of the `make_circles` dataset

## Setup

Requires Python with `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn`. Run the notebook in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.
